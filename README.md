# My readme/operating manual

Hi, and welcome to this Readme document. Recently, it's [become quite popular](https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs/) for tech leads to share information about themselves as managers. Something similar to a projects README, but for working with managers. Leaving hype aside, I think this is a great idea, and it could help to build trust in a team and [share expectations](https://mattnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/). So I decided to take advice from my good friend [Kiryl Kavalenka](https://github.com/kkav004), and create the one about myself.

As recommended, I will keep this document live and update regularly. Also, if anything in it seems off, feel free to open an issue or a PR or talk about it in 1-on-1 meeting.

# Expectations of me as your manager

- First, and the most important of all - **communication**. One of my responsibilities is to provide context and make sure the team is familiar with the priorities, challenges and goals. If you want to talk about anything, or there is something unclear, go ahead and schedule a meeting in my public calendar. Alternatively, you can always use slack/email.
- Again, **communication**. I will always communicate in a clear and honest way. You will never have to guess what I "really" think, or read between the lines of what I'm saying. If that happens, please let me know because it's not intentional.
- I will be guiding the project **technical vision**, i.e. what technologies we're using, what the milestones of the project are, how are we going to deliver the project, what frameworks we use, etc. That doesn't mean code micromanagement or imposing technical decisions on the team. You know best. I'll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you implement your ideas, but I won't override you. **I want to ensure a technical vision exists and is shared by the team.** Also, this vision needs to be in line with the product and customers' requirements.
- **Discussions**. Ideas improve by being criticised and examined from different angles. When it sounds like I'm disagreeing I'm most likely just playing devil's advocate. Or acting as a [rubber duck](https://t2m.io/8TaLSLtB). I'll challenge your ideas to arrive at the best possible solution, and I hope you'll challenge mine.
- I believe that if a technical problem can be (even theoretically) solved, then we can find a solution. I will be helping you by pointing to the right direction, but helping does not mean doing all the work for you.
- **Learning and Development.** I encourage team members to learn, but it is your career, and you probably know better in which direction you'd like to grow. What I can do for you, is to help set goals and priorities, and help you work on them.
- I encourage and model a **healthy work-life balance** to help avoid burnout. I  follow a few simple rules, beautifully summarised here: [https://t2m.io/Anv2KKiR](https://t2m.io/Anv2KKiR)

# My expectations of teammates

- **Do fantastic work** and notify me if something preventing you from accomplishing this.
- **Communicate effectively and frequently** and please reach out and tell me if anything, at all, feels off.
- If you'd agreed to do something and be responsible for it, then please do it.
- **Learn to grow and grow to learn.** I'll try to provide opportunities for growth and learning, but it will be up to you to take advantage of them. Please invest in yourself and focus on self-improvement.
- **Feedback** is essential for our growth. Everyone makes mistakes, and I would like to correct and learn from them. I believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team. It is very likely that your feedback will impact the relationship and mutual understanding straight away.

# Management practices I use

## One-on-ones

Highly likely, that we'll have a **1:1** (regular talks on an individual basis) every week for at least 30 minutes. Coffee in the cafe, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best (I prefer a walk :) ). Feel free to come with a topic you'd like to discuss. Even better if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time.

## Implementation plan

This is a document, that contains an overview of the project, a brief description of the major tasks involved in the implementation, the overall timeframe and resources needed to support the implementation effort.

All estimations are done in collaboration with the team.

## Standups

Standard daily 15 min meetings, where everyone gives a quick update on the following: 

    What did you do yesterday?
    What will you do today?
    Are there any obstacles in your way?
    How can the team help?

## Technical

In addition to a project being on-track, I value when it contains the following:

- Full and complete CI/CD for all project's parts
- [Feature flags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7707383/what-is-a-feature-flag)
- Polite, effective and helpful **code reviews**. See [The art of reviewing code](https://blog.usejournal.com/the-art-of-reviewing-code-e10a3a830a2e) and [Code Review Best Practices](https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f)
- **Tests**: there's no need to aim for 100% test coverage, or for any other pre-defined number. On the other hand, sufficiency of testing is much more complicated attribute than coverage can answer. I also recommend reading [this great piece](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html) by Martin Fowler.

I want to sincerely thank all the tech leads and managers who made their readmes publicly available. It helped a lot in consolidating my thoughts.
